Questions

- I am on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS. I installed g++-12. As per the g++-12 man pages it is supporting only C++ 17. But by now C++ 20 and C++ 23, both are released. Currently g++-12 shows the following message for both the versions. How can I compile my C++ programs using C++ 20 to C++ 23 releases in my current operating system?

  - The 2020 ISO C++ standard plus amendments. Support is experimental, and could change in incompatible ways in future releases.

- What are some good formatters for C++? Do we need to install one?

  - C / C++ Extension Pack from Microsoft comes with formatter for C / C++; you need to configure it.

- What are the most used C++ extensions in Visual Studio Code?
